Exploring the Impact of Economic Factors on Rental Prices in Nashville: An Analysis of GDP, Industry Growth, and Inflation
Executive Summary
"Exploring the Impact of Economic Factors on Rental Prices in Nashville: An Analysis of GDP, Industry Growth, and Inflation"

The objective of this data analysis capstone project is to examine the impact of economic factors on housing rental prices in Nashville. The study investigates several key areas, including the correlation between changes in Nashville's GDP and rental price fluctuations, the relationship between industry growth in various neighborhoods and increased rental prices, the correlation between short-term rental density and surrounding long-term rental prices, and the potential of using the inflation rate as a predictor for rental prices. The purpose is to gain valuable insights into the dynamics of the rental market in Nashville.

Motivation
The motivation behind this data analysis capstone project stems from the recognition of the critical role that economic factors play in shaping the rental market in Nashville. As an aspiring data analyst with a personal investment interest in real estate, the aim was to delve into the factors influencing rental prices and understand their impact on housing affordability in Nashville.

Nashville, being a vibrant and rapidly growing city, has witnessed significant changes in its economic landscape in recent years. The project's focus on exploring the correlation between changes in Nashville's GDP and rental price fluctuations arises from the need to comprehend how the city's economic performance directly influences housing rental costs. Understanding this relationship can provide valuable insights for policymakers, real estate investors, and residents seeking affordable housing options.

Data Questions
How does the annual change in Nashville's GDP correlate with the annual percentage change in rental prices over a specific time period? Is there a significant difference in rental price fluctuations between neighborhoods with different levels of industry growth in Nashville? What is the relationship between the density of short-term rentals and the average long-term rental prices in different neighborhoods of Nashville?  Are there specific industries or sectors that demonstrate a stronger correlation with rental price increases compared to others? How do macroeconomic factors (e.g., interest rates, consumer confidence) impact the rental market in Nashville? Can these factors be used to predict rental price movements?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP for the final capstone project will consist of a comprehensive report that explores the impact of economic factors on rental prices in Nashville. The report will include visualizations, statistical analysis, and key findings to present a clear understanding of the relationship between economic variables and rental prices. The intended audience for the MVP would be newcomers to Nashville in need of rentals, stakeholders in the real estate industry, investors, policymakers, and housing market analysts.

Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them. Be sure to include:
●	Forecasting accuracy: Forecasting rental prices based on economic indicators like inflation may be subject to uncertainty and errors. 
●	Identifying causality vs. correlation: Establishing causality between economic factors and rental prices will be challenging.
●	Data availability and quality: Incomplete or inconsistent data could affect the accuracy and reliability of my analysis. Also since I am resubmitting this project with only 48 hours to find data, I am not positive I have everything I need.
●	Data preprocessing may be complex and beyond my skill set.
